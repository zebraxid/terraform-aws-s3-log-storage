description: |-
  This module creates an S3 bucket suitable for receiving logs from other `AWS` services such as `S3`, `CloudFront`, and `CloudTrails`.

  It implements a configurable log retention policy, which allows you to efficiently manage logs across different storage classes (_e.g._ `Glacier`) and ultimately expire the data altogether.

  It enables server-side default encryption.

  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html

  It blocks public access to the bucket by default.
